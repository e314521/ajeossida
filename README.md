# Ajeossida (아저씨다)
Frida with patches that definitively fix basic detection points on Android and iOS.<br> 
Unfortunately, I discovered that the patches in several custom Frida builds for bypassing detections are incomplete and still detectable.<br>
For example, `frida_agent_main` in memory and the `gum-js-loop` thread name.<br> 
Therefore, I created a Python build script to address these issues.

Since this is a manual patch that doesn't automatically follow the Frida upstream,<br> 
I will occasionally build it, verify that the patch works properly, and then release it.

# MagiskAjeossida
* A magisk module that automatically runs ajeossida-server on boot.  
* To run it in remote mode, use the following command. It will listen on `0.0.0.0:45678`.  
`adb shell "su -c sed -i 's/REMOTE=0/REMOTE=1/' /data/adb/modules/magisk_ajeossida/service.sh"`
* You can attach Frida to a pairipcore protected app using this module.  
However, the app will crash after a few seconds. Bypassing the crash is up to you. (Spawning the app also causes it to crash)
